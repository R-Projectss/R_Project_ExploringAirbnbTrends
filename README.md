# R_Project_ExploringAirbnbTrends


As a consultant working for a real estate start-up, you have collected Airbnb listing data from various sources to investigate the short-term rental market in New York. You'll analyze this data to provide insights on private rooms to the real estate company.

There are three files in the data folder: airbnb_price.csv, airbnb_room_type.xlsx, airbnb_last_review.tsv.

What are the dates of the earliest and most recent reviews?
How many of the listings are private rooms?
What is the average listing price for all rooms (rounded to the nearest penny)?
Combine these four values into one tibble called review_dates with four columns: first_reviewed, last_reviewed, nb_private_rooms, and avg_price. The tibble should only contain one row of values.
